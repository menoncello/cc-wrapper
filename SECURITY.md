# Security Policy

## Security Status

This document outlines the security practices and policies for the CC Wrapper project.

## Security Practices

### Development Environment Security

1. **No Hardcoded Credentials in Production Code**
   - Development passwords are unique to this project
   - Production credentials must use environment variables
   - Database passwords use generated values, not dictionary words

2. **Command Execution Security**
   - All shell commands use parameterized execution
   - No dynamic command construction with user input
   - Commands executed through Bun's `$` template literal system for safety

3. **Environment Variable Security**
   - Sensitive data stored in `.env.local` (gitignored)
   - Validation of all environment variables
   - Type checking for URL-based configurations

### Database Security

1. **Development Database**
   - Uses unique password: `ccwrapper_dev_pass_2025`
   - Database name: `ccwrapper_dev`
   - User: `ccwrapper`
   - Port: 5432 (standard)

2. **Connection Security**
   - All database connections use parameterized queries
   - URL validation prevents malformed connection strings
   - Protocol validation ensures only allowed protocols (postgresql, redis)

### Input Validation

1. **URL Validation**
   - All URL-based environment variables are validated
   - Protocol checking prevents malformed URLs
   - Hostname validation ensures proper connection targets

2. **Port Validation**
   - Port numbers are validated to be within valid range (1-65535)
   - Default ports provided when not specified

3. **Environment Validation**
   - Required environment variables are checked at startup
   - Missing variables cause immediate failure with clear error messages

## Security Checklist

### Development Setup Security

- [x] No hardcoded production passwords
- [x] Unique development database password
- [x] Environment variable validation
- [x] URL validation for database connections
- [x] Port range validation
- [x] No dynamic command construction

### Production Security (Future Implementation)

- [ ] Production secrets management
- [ ] Encrypted secrets storage
- [ ] Database connection encryption
- [ ] API key rotation procedures
- [ ] Access logging and monitoring
- [ ] Security audit logging

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

### How to Report

1. **Private Issues Only**
   - Do not create public GitHub issues for security problems
   - Use private communication channels

2. **Provide Details**
   - Describe the vulnerability clearly
   - Include steps to reproduce (if safe)
   - Explain potential impact

3. **Responsible Disclosure**
   - Allow reasonable time to fix before disclosure
   - Work with maintainers on coordinated release

### Contact

For security issues, contact the project maintainers through private channels.

## Security Updates

### Version Information

- Current security version: 1.0.0
- Last security review: 2025-10-19
- Next review scheduled: 2026-01-19

### Update Process

1. **Assessment**
   - Evaluate vulnerability severity
   - Determine impact assessment
   - Plan remediation timeline

2. **Fix Development**
   - Develop secure patches
   - Test fixes thoroughly
   - Update documentation

3. **Release**
   - Coordinate disclosure timeline
   - Release security updates
   - Update security policies

## Best Practices

### Development

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`
   - Use different passwords for development/production

2. **Validate all inputs**
   - Validate environment variables at startup
   - Check URL formats and protocols
   - Validate numeric ranges (ports, etc.)

3. **Use secure defaults**
   - Require explicit configuration for sensitive operations
   - Fail securely when configuration is invalid
   - Provide clear error messages for debugging

### Deployment

1. **Environment separation**
   - Different configurations for development/production
   - Unique passwords for each environment
   - Separate databases for different environments

2. **Access control**
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews
   - Audit logging for sensitive operations
