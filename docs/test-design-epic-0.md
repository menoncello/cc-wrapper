**Status:** Planned
**Verification:** Measure setup success rate across different platforms, target >95%

### R-002: Dependency Version Conflicts (Score: 6)

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. Development team has administrative access to install development tools
2. All development machines meet minimum hardware requirements (8GB RAM, modern CPU)
3. External services (npm registry, Docker Hub) remain available and stable
4. Team members have basic familiarity with modern JavaScript/TypeScript development tools

### Dependencies

1. Bun 1.3.0 runtime availability by 2025-10-26
2. Docker 28.5.1 installation access for all team members
3. PostgreSQL 18.0 and Redis 8.2.2 compatibility with development machines
4. GitHub repository access for CI/CD pipeline configuration

### Risks to Plan

- **Risk**: Development tool incompatibility across team member machines
  - **Impact**: Reduces team productivity and delays onboarding
  - **Contingency**: Container-based development environment as fallback option

- **Risk**: External service dependencies (npm, Docker Hub) availability
  - **Impact**: Could block dependency installation and setup
  - **Contingency**: Package mirrors and local caching strategies
