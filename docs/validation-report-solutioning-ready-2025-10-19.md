SSO, audit logging) ✅ Testing assessed (Bun Test + Playwright strategy) ✅
Specialist sections integrated into architecture

#### Step 8: PRD Updates - 2/2 (100%) ✅

#### Optional Files - 2/4 (50%) ⚠

✅ DevOps strategy integrated in main architecture ✅ Security strategy
integrated in main architecture ✅ Test strategy integrated in main architecture
➖ Handoff instructions not created (integrated approach selected) Impact: No
specialist placeholders created - all strategies integrated

## Failed Items

**None** - All critical requirements met

## Partial Items

**⚠ Skill Level Adaptation:**

- Issue: Architecture complexity may be advanced for intermediate users
- Impact: Consider adding simplified explanations or learning resources
- Recommendation: Create developer onboarding guide with architecture
  walkthrough

**⚠ Specialist Handoff Documentation:**

- Issue: No separate handoff instructions created
- Impact: Integration approach selected instead of placeholder creation
- Recommendation: Document integration approach in implementation guide

## Recommendations

### 1. Must Fix: None

All critical requirements satisfied for Phase 4 progression.

### 2. Should Improve:

- Create developer onboarding guide explaining architecture decisions
- Document integration approach for specialist areas
- Consider adding architecture decision records (ADRs) for major choices

### 3. Consider:

- Add performance benchmarking targets
- Create migration guide for different user skill levels
- Document monitoring and observability strategy

## Final Assessment

**✅ APPROVED FOR PHASE 4 - IMPLEMENTATION**

The CC Wrapper solutioning workflow has successfully completed all critical
requirements with a 92% pass rate. The project demonstrates:

1. **Comprehensive Architecture:** Well-defined microservices with clear
   boundaries
2. **Technology Excellence:** Modern stack with specific versions and strong
   justifications
3. **Requirements Alignment:** 100% coverage of functional and non-functional
   requirements
4. **Implementation Readiness:** All tech specs completed with 95% story
   readiness
5. **Quality Standards:** Design-focused approach without over-specification

The project is ready to proceed to Phase 4 implementation with Epic 1: Core
Value Delivery & Wait-Time Optimization as the recommended starting point.
