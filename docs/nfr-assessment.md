- **Threshold:** ≥80% test coverage
- **Actual:** UNKNOWN - No coverage reports found
- **Evidence:** Test files exist (setup.test.ts, health-check.test.ts, setup-workflow.test.ts) but no coverage data
- **Findings:** Tests exist but coverage evidence missing
- **Recommendation:** HIGH - Run tests with coverage reporting to establish baseline

### Documentation

- **Status:** PASS ✅
- **Threshold:** ≥90% documentation completeness
- **Actual:** Comprehensive documentation found
- **Evidence:** PRD.md, story-0.1.md with detailed requirements and implementation notes
- **Findings:** Excellent documentation with clear requirements and implementation tracking

---

## Quick Wins

1. **Generate Test Coverage Report** (Maintainability) - HIGH - 10 minutes
   - Run `bun test --coverage` to establish coverage baseline
   - No code changes needed, just run existing tests with coverage flag

2. **Create .env.example Template** (Security) - HIGH - 5 minutes
   - Create environment variable template for developers
   - Document required variables and their purposes

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before Release) - CRITICAL/HIGH Priority

1. **Generate test coverage evidence** - HIGH - 10 minutes - Development Team
   - Run tests with coverage: `bun test --coverage`
   - Save coverage report to docs/coverage/
   - Validate coverage meets 80% threshold

2. **Create environment variable template** - HIGH - 5 minutes - Development Team
   - Create .env.example with all required variables
   - Add documentation for each variable
   - Ensure no secrets checked into version control

### Short-term (Next Sprint) - MEDIUM Priority

1. **Add performance monitoring to setup script** - MEDIUM - 2 hours - Development Team
   - Track setup execution time
   - Monitor resource usage during setup
   - Generate performance report

2. **Establish CI/CD pipeline** - MEDIUM - 1 day - DevOps Team
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Include security scanning

## Evidence Gaps

- [ ] **Test execution results** (Maintainability)
  - Owner: Development Team
  - Deadline: 2025-10-20
  - Suggested Evidence: Run `bun test --coverage` and save results
  - Impact: Cannot validate test coverage without execution evidence

- [ ] **Performance metrics** (Performance)
  - Owner: Development Team
  - Deadline: 2025-10-20
  - Suggested Evidence: Time setup script execution and resource usage
  - Impact: Cannot validate 60-second setup target without metrics

- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline results** (Reliability)
  - Owner: DevOps Team
  - Deadline: 2025-10-27
  - Suggested Evidence: Create and run GitHub Actions workflow
  - Impact: Cannot validate automated quality gates without CI evidence
