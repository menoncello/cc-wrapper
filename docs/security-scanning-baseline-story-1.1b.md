## Security Scanning Architecture

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/security-scanning.yml`

**Triggers:**

- Push to main/develop/story branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Daily scheduled runs (3 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch for on-demand scanning

**Execution Strategy:**

- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple security scans run concurrently
- **Conditional Logic**: DAST only runs on main branch or schedule
- **Failure Handling**: Individual scan failures don't stop other scans
- **Security Gates**: Critical issues block pipeline progression

### Security Scan Configuration

- **Medium**: Moderate risk, address within 30 days
- **Low**: Minor risk, address in next release cycle
- **Informational**: No immediate risk, track for future

### Security Scan Scheduling

| Scan Type        | Frequency    | Trigger  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| SAST             | Every commit | Push/PR  |
| Dependency Check | Daily        | Schedule |
| Secrets Scan     | Every commit | Push/PR  |
| Container Scan   | On build     | Push/PR  |
