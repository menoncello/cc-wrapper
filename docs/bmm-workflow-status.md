## Decisions Log

- **2025-10-18**: Completed brainstorm-project workflow. Generated comprehensive brainstorming session results with 50+ ideas covering architecture, UI design, technical implementation, and user experience. Key insights: root problem is productivity optimization during AI wait times, three-column layout design, hybrid TUI approach, and web→Tauri evolution strategy. Results saved to docs/brainstorming-session-results-2025-10-18.md.
- **2025-10-18**: Completed market research workflow. Conducted comprehensive market intelligence on AI developer productivity tools market ($13.8B by 2025, 34.2% CAGR). Identified $890M SAM opportunity for AI orchestration layer with CC Wrapper positioned for $31.2M realistic SOM. Key findings: 67% of enterprises use 2+ AI tools, 89% of developers report productivity loss during wait times, 94% of current tools lack multi-instance management. Research report saved to docs/research-market-2025-10-18.md. Next: Proceed with product-brief workflow to formalize vision and strategy.
- **2025-10-18**: Completed research workflow (deep-prompt mode). Generated comprehensive deep research prompt for "Hybrid TUI implementation strategies for web interfaces that mirror terminal applications" with focus on real-time synchronization, state management, and terminal emulation. Research prompt optimized for multiple AI platforms and saved to docs/research-deep-prompt-2025-10-18.md. Next: Execute prompt with AI platform or continue with product-brief workflow.
- **2025-10-18**: Completed research workflow (technical mode). Comprehensive technical architecture research for Bun + Elysia + Docker + Xterm.js + PostgreSQL stack. Key findings: 4x performance improvement over Node.js, 50% memory reduction, support for 10,000+ concurrent WebSocket connections, and optimal container-per-project isolation strategy. Technical research report generated and saved to docs/research-technical-2025-10-18.md. Technology stack decisions finalized: Bun runtime, Elysia framework, Docker Compose for orchestration, Xterm.js for terminal emulation, PostgreSQL for state management. Next: Review all research findings and proceed with product-brief workflow.
- **2025-10-18**: Completed research workflow (competitive intelligence mode). Deep dive competitive intelligence analysis revealing CC Wrapper's unique market position with no direct competitors in AI orchestration layer. Key findings: Wait time optimization represents first-to-market innovation addressing $2.1B productivity losses, CCswarm as only emerging direct competitor (open source, limited features), and clear differentiation from AI IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf) and single-model assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code). Strategic positioning established as integration-first orchestration platform with premium pricing $15-25/user/month. Competitive intelligence report saved to docs/research-competitive-2025-10-18.md. Next: Review all research findings and proceed with product-brief workflow to formalize competitive strategy.
- **2025-10-19**: Completed research workflow (user research mode). Comprehensive user research revealing three distinct developer personas (Enterprise Alex, SMB Sarah, Independent Ian) experiencing acute pain points in AI tool management. Key findings: 89% productivity loss during AI wait times, 76% context switching pain, and clear willingness to pay ($15-25/user/month for enterprise, $8-15/month for SMB, $5-12/month for individual). User research report generated with detailed personas, behavior analysis, and feature prioritization saved to docs/research-user-2025-10-19.md. Next: Proceed with product-brief workflow to formalize vision and strategy based on comprehensive research foundation.
- **2025-10-19**: Completed PRD workflow. Generated comprehensive Product Requirements Document defining strategic vision, functional and non-functional requirements, user journeys, UX/UI principles, and 5-epic delivery sequence with 43 detailed stories. Created complete tactical implementation roadmap with story breakdown covering core infrastructure, multi-AI tool integration, wait time optimization, cost management, and enterprise features. Project level determined as Level 3 (complex product, 6-12 months timeline). Enhanced requirements through advanced elicitation including dependency mapping, risk analysis, stakeholder round table, failure mode analysis, and pre-mortem analysis. PRD saved to docs/PRD.md and detailed epic breakdown saved to docs/epics.md with 18 fully detailed stories and roadmap for remaining 23-33 stories. Enhanced epic sequencing addresses key failure modes through value-first delivery and early enterprise trust building. Next: Proceed to ux-spec workflow for detailed UI/UX design.
- **2025-10-19**: Completed solution-architecture workflow. Generated comprehensive solution architecture with microservices design, real-time synchronization, and wait-time optimization foundation. Architecture decisions include Bun runtime + Elysia framework for performance, PostgreSQL + Redis for data management, WebSocket-based real-time communication, and container-per-project isolation. Cohesion check shows 95% readiness with all functional requirements covered. Solution architecture saved to docs/solution-architecture.md with detailed technical specifications, API design, database schema, and deployment strategy. Cohesion check report saved to docs/cohesion-check-report.md. Epic 1 tech specification created with detailed implementation guidance. Phase 3 (Solutioning) complete. Ready for Phase 4 (Implementation) with SM agent story drafting.
- **2025-10-19**: Completed tech-spec workflow for Epic 0. Generated comprehensive technical specification for Project Bootstrap & Development Infrastructure based on sprint change proposal. Tech spec includes detailed design for development environment setup, project structure, build systems, quality tools, testing frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines. Specification covers 13 acceptance criteria across 2 stories (0.1: Development Environment Setup, 0.2: Project Structure & Build System) with complete traceability mapping and comprehensive test strategy. Tech spec saved to docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md. This is a JIT workflow establishing foundational development infrastructure for all subsequent epics. Phase 3 (Solutioning) complete with Epic 0 technical foundation ready for implementation.
