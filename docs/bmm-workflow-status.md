- **2025-10-18**: Completed research workflow (competitive intelligence mode). Deep dive competitive intelligence analysis revealing CC Wrapper's unique market position with no direct competitors in AI orchestration layer. Key findings: Wait time optimization represents first-to-market innovation addressing $2.1B productivity losses, CCswarm as only emerging direct competitor (open source, limited features), and clear differentiation from AI IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf) and single-model assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code). Strategic positioning established as integration-first orchestration platform with premium pricing $15-25/user/month. Competitive intelligence report saved to docs/research-competitive-2025-10-18.md. Next: Review all research findings and proceed with product-brief workflow to formalize competitive strategy.
