### Quality Assessment

#### Tests with Issues

**WARNING Issues** ⚠️

- **E2E tests (25 total)** - Status: RED (failing) - All E2E tests awaiting
  frontend implementation
  - Files: `tests/e2e/onboarding-wizard.spec.ts`,
    `tests/e2e/auth-registration.spec.ts`
  - Remediation: Implement Astro + React UI components for onboarding, tour,
    profile settings

- **Integration tests (2/3 complete)** - Status: PARTIAL - Rate limiting and
  workspace tests marked TODO
  - File: `tests/integration/auth/auth-flow.test.ts:305`
  - Remediation: Complete rate limiting integration tests or move to API test
    level

**BLOCKER Issues** ❌

- None detected in test quality (tests follow Given-When-Then, use factories,
  explicit assertions)

**INFO Issues** ℹ️

- OAuth tests use mocked callbacks - Consider integration testing with real
  OAuth provider test accounts

---

#### Tests Passing Quality Gates

**41/73 tests (56%) meet all quality criteria** ✅

- Unit tests: 15/15 (100%) ✅
- Integration tests: 3/5 (60%) ⚠️
- API tests: 20/20 (100%) ✅
- E2E tests: 0/33 (0%) ❌ (all RED - awaiting implementation)
- Component tests: 0/0 (N/A)

**Quality Checklist:**

- ✅ Explicit assertions (not hidden in helpers)
- ✅ Given-When-Then structure
- ✅ Factory-based test data for parallel execution
- ✅ Self-cleaning (afterEach cleanup)
- ✅ No hard waits or sleeps
- ⚠️ Some tests missing implementation (RED status is expected for ATDD
  approach)

---

### Duplicate Coverage Analysis

#### Acceptable Overlap (Defense in Depth)

- **AC-1 Authentication**: Tested at Unit (crypto logic), API (endpoints),
  Integration (flow), E2E (user journey) ✅
  - Unit: Password hashing, JWT signing
  - API: Registration/login endpoints, OAuth callbacks
  - Integration: Full auth flow with database
  - E2E: User interface interactions
  - **Rationale:** Security-critical functionality requires multi-level
    validation

#### No Unacceptable Duplication Detected ✅

- Tests follow selective testing principles
- Each level tests appropriate concerns (logic → unit, contracts → API, user
  experience → E2E)

---

### Coverage by Test Level

| Test Level  | Tests  | Criteria Covered  | Coverage % |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ---------- |
| E2E         | 33     | 5/6 (partial)     | 83%        |
| API         | 20     | 1/6 (AC-1 only)   | 17%        |
| Integration | 5      | 1/6 (AC-1 only)   | 17%        |
| Unit        | 15     | 2/6 (AC-1, AC-6)  | 33%        |
| Component   | 0      | 0/6               | 0%         |
| **Total**   | **73** | **6/6 (partial)** | **67%**    |

**Notes:**

- E2E tests cover all ACs but are RED (failing) - awaiting frontend
  implementation
- Backend unit/API tests only cover AC-1 (authentication) - backend is complete
  for this AC
- Component tests not yet written (frontend deferred per story completion notes)

---

### Traceability Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (Before PR Merge)

1. **Implement Frontend UI for AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5** - Onboarding wizard,
   workspace configuration, guided tour, skip functionality. Required to turn
   E2E tests GREEN and achieve P0 coverage.
2. **Complete AC-6 Profile Settings UI** - Required for P2 coverage completion.
3. **Run E2E test suite after UI implementation** - Validate all 33 E2E tests
   pass with completed frontend.

#### Short-term Actions (This Sprint)

1. **Complete Integration Tests** - Finish rate limiting and workspace
   integration tests (2 TODOs remaining).
2. **Add Component Tests** - Create component-level tests for onboarding wizard,
   tour overlay, profile settings (currently 0 component tests).
3. **Validate OAuth with Real Provider Test Accounts** - Move from mocked OAuth
   to real Google/GitHub test credentials for higher confidence.

#### Long-term Actions (Backlog)

1. **Add Performance Tests** - Validate onboarding load time <2s (per story
   performance targets).
2. **Add Accessibility Tests** - Validate WCAG compliance for onboarding wizard
   and profile settings.

### Decision Criteria Evaluation

#### P0 Criteria (Must ALL Pass)

| Criterion             | Threshold | Actual | Status  |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| P0 Coverage           | 100%      | 67%    | ❌ FAIL |
| P0 Test Pass Rate     | 100%      | 100%   | ✅ PASS |
| Security Issues       | 0         | 0      | ✅ PASS |
| Critical NFR Failures | 0         | 0      | ✅ PASS |
| Flaky Tests           | 0         | 0      | ✅ PASS |

**P0 Evaluation**: ❌ FAILED (P0 Coverage below 100%)

**Rationale:** AC-2 (onboarding wizard) and AC-3 (workspace configuration) lack
frontend implementation, resulting in 67% P0 coverage instead of required 100%.

---

#### P1 Criteria (Required for PASS, May Accept for CONCERNS)

| Criterion              | Threshold | Actual | Status  |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| P1 Coverage            | ≥90%      | 0%     | ❌ FAIL |
| P1 Test Pass Rate      | ≥95%      | N/A    | ❌ FAIL |
| Overall Test Pass Rate | ≥90%      | 100%   | ✅ PASS |
| Overall Coverage       | ≥80%      | 67%    | ❌ FAIL |

**P1 Evaluation**: ❌ FAILED (P1 coverage at 0%, overall coverage below 80%)

**Rationale:** AC-4 (guided tour) and AC-5 (skip functionality) completely
missing, resulting in 0% P1 coverage. Overall coverage at 67% falls below 80%
threshold.

---

### GATE DECISION: ❌ FAIL

---

### Rationale

**Why FAIL (not PASS):**

- **P0 Coverage Incomplete (67% vs required 100%)**: AC-2 (onboarding wizard)
  and AC-3 (workspace configuration UI) lack frontend implementation. This is a
  critical blocker as onboarding is a core user journey.
- **P1 Coverage Missing (0% vs required 90%)**: AC-4 (guided tour) and AC-5
  (skip functionality) are completely unimplemented. This violates the quality
  gate for high-priority features.
- **Overall Coverage Below Threshold (67% vs required 80%)**: Only 4/6
  acceptance criteria have FULL or PARTIAL coverage.
- **Frontend Implementation Deferred**: Per Story 1.1 completion notes (lines
  160-165), frontend UI components (AC-2, 4, 5, 6) were intentionally deferred
  to a separate frontend-focused story. This decision was made to prioritize
  backend infrastructure.

**Why FAIL (not CONCERNS):**

- P0 gaps cannot be waived (per gate decision rules)
- Missing 2/3 P0 criteria is systemic, not isolated
- This is not a minor threshold miss (67% vs 100% is significant)

**Backend vs Frontend Split:**

The backend implementation for Story 1.1 is **COMPLETE and HIGH QUALITY**:

- ✅ Authentication API with email/password and OAuth (AC-1)
- ✅ Bun-native crypto (Argon2id + JWT with Web Crypto API)
- ✅ Rate limiting, input validation, error handling
- ✅ 41/41 backend tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit, API, and integration test coverage for backend
- ✅ Security requirements met (JWT, password hashing, OAuth CSRF protection)

However, **frontend UI is missing**, causing gate failure:

- ❌ Onboarding wizard (AC-2)
- ❌ Workspace configuration UI (AC-3)
- ❌ Guided tour (AC-4)
- ❌ Skip functionality UI (AC-5)
- ❌ Profile settings page (AC-6)

**Recommendation:**

Story 1.1 should be **split into two stories**:

1. **Story 1.1a (Backend)**: Authentication & User Data - COMPLETE ✅
2. **Story 1.1b (Frontend)**: Onboarding UI & Guided Tour - NOT STARTED ❌

Current gate decision: **FAIL** for Story 1.1 as originally scoped.

### Gate Recommendations

#### For FAIL Decision ❌

1. **Block Deployment Immediately**
   - Do NOT deploy Story 1.1 in current state
   - Notify stakeholders: Frontend UI components missing for AC-2, 3, 4, 5
   - Escalate to product manager and tech lead

2. **Fix Critical Issues**
   - **Option A**: Implement frontend UI for AC-2, 3, 4, 5 (estimated 8-12 days
     based on test design)
   - **Option B**: Split story into 1.1a (Backend - DONE) and 1.1b (Frontend -
     NEW)
   - Owner assignments: Assign frontend team to implement Astro + React
     components
   - Daily standup on blocker resolution

3. **Re-Run Gate After Fixes**
   - Complete frontend implementation
   - Run full E2E test suite (32 tests currently RED)
   - Re-run `bmad tea *trace 1.1` workflow
   - Verify decision is PASS before deploying

**Deployment BLOCKED until P0 gaps resolved** ❌

### Residual Risks (For CONCERNS or WAIVED)

_Not applicable - Decision is FAIL, not CONCERNS or WAIVED_

---

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions** (next 24-48 hours):

1. Escalate to Product Manager: Story 1.1 frontend scope missing, backend
   complete
2. Decision required: Continue Story 1.1 with frontend OR split into 1.1a
   (DONE) + 1.1b (NEW)
3. If continuing Story 1.1: Assign frontend team, create implementation plan for
   AC-2, 3, 4, 5

**Follow-up Actions** (next sprint/release):

1. Implement Astro + React onboarding wizard (AC-2)
2. Implement workspace configuration UI (AC-3)
3. Implement guided tour overlay component (AC-4)
4. Implement skip functionality with confirmation (AC-5)
5. Implement profile settings page (AC-6)
6. Run full E2E test suite and verify 32 RED tests turn GREEN
7. Re-run traceability and gate decision workflow

**Stakeholder Communication**:

- **Notify PM**: Story 1.1 gate decision is FAIL due to missing frontend
  implementation (4/6 ACs incomplete). Backend is complete and high quality.
  Recommend splitting story or continuing with frontend focus.
- **Notify SM**: Story 1.1 backend work complete (estimated 60% of total
  effort), frontend work not started (estimated 40% remaining). Update sprint
  planning accordingly.
- **Notify DEV lead**: Backend team delivered high-quality authentication
  infrastructure. Frontend team needs to implement UI components for onboarding,
  tour, profile settings.
