## Mitigation Plans

### R-001: Multi-AI API integration complexity (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement unified AI adapter pattern that abstracts
differences between Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot APIs. Create credential
vault for secure storage. **Owner:** Backend Team **Timeline:** Story 1.3
completion **Status:** Planned **Verification:** Integration tests validate all
three AI APIs with consistent interface

### R-005: API credential storage and encryption (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use encrypted credential storage with AES-256
encryption and key rotation. Implement secure credential injection at runtime.
**Owner:** Infrastructure Team **Timeline:** Story 1.3 completion **Status:**
Planned **Verification:** Security tests validate encryption/decryption and
prevent credential leakage

### R-006: Session data encryption at rest (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement user-controlled encryption keys for session
data. Use AES-256 with PBKDF2 key derivation from user password. **Owner:**
Infrastructure Team **Timeline:** Story 1.2 completion **Status:** Planned
**Verification:** Unit tests validate encryption strength and key management

### R-008: Real-time synchronization latency (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Primary WebSocket connection with polling fallback.
Implement conflict resolution and state compression. **Owner:** Frontend Team
**Timeline:** Story 1.6 completion **Status:** Planned **Verification:**
Performance tests measure <100ms sync latency under load

### R-011: Session corruption during unexpected shutdowns (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Automatic backup every 30 seconds with corruption
detection using checksums. Implement recovery from last good state. **Owner:**
Infrastructure Team **Timeline:** Story 1.2 completion **Status:** Planned
**Verification:** Chaos engineering tests simulate crashes and verify recovery

### R-014: "5-minute wow" experience failure (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Guided onboarding with guaranteed time-savings
demonstration. Track actual productivity improvements in first session.
**Owner:** Product Team **Timeline:** Story 1.10 completion **Status:** Planned
**Verification:** User testing validates 90% achieve measurable productivity in
first 5 minutes

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. AI service APIs (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) remain stable and
   accessible
2. Users have existing accounts with AI services for credential integration
3. Development team has experience with real-time synchronization patterns
4. Security requirements allow for user-controlled encryption keys
5. Performance targets (<100ms sync, <5s recovery) are achievable with chosen
   technology stack

### Dependencies

1. AI service API documentation and test environments - Required by Story 1.3
2. Encryption libraries with AES-256 support - Required by Story 1.2
3. WebSocket infrastructure for real-time sync - Required by Story 1.6
4. Performance monitoring tools - Required by Story 1.9

### Risks to Plan

- **Risk**: AI service API changes during development
  - **Impact**: High - could delay integration testing
  - **Contingency**: Implement adapter pattern to absorb API changes

- **Risk**: Performance targets not achievable with WebSocket
  - **Impact**: Medium - would require architecture changes
  - **Contingency**: Fallback to polling with optimization
