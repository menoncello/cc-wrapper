## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

No critical issues detected. ✅

---

## Recommendations (Should Fix)

### 1. Network-First Pattern Optimization (2 minor improvements)

**Severity**: P3 (Low) **Location**: `onboarding-tour.spec.ts:17`,
`user-profile-workspace.spec.ts:16` **Criterion**: Network-First Pattern
**Knowledge Base**:
[network-first.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/network-first.md)

**Issue Description**: Two tests set up route interception after page
navigation, which could potentially cause race conditions in slow network
environments.

**Current Code**:

```typescript
// ⚠️ Could be improved (current implementation)
await page.goto('/dashboard?tour=start');
// Network interception setup after navigation
await page.route('**/api/**', route => route.continue());
```

**Recommended Improvement**:

```typescript
// ✅ Better approach (recommended)
// Network-first: Setup interception before navigation
await page.route('**/api/**', route => route.continue());
await page.goto('/dashboard?tour=start');
```

**Benefits**: Prevents potential race conditions where API calls might fire
before route interception is set up.

**Priority**: Low - Current tests are stable, but following network-first
pattern consistently improves reliability.

## Best Practices Found

### 1. Exceptional BDD Structure Implementation

**Location**: All test files **Pattern**: Given-When-Then Organization
**Knowledge Base**:
[test-quality.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/test-quality.md)

**Why This Is Good**: Every test follows clear BDD structure with explicit
GIVEN/WHEN/THEN comments, making test intent immediately readable.

**Code Example**:

```typescript
// ✅ Excellent pattern demonstrated in all tests
test('should complete full onboarding wizard', async ({
  page,
  authenticatedUser
}) => {
  // GIVEN: Authenticated user lands on onboarding wizard
  await page.setExtraHTTPHeaders({
    Authorization: `Bearer ${authenticatedUser.token}`
  });
  await page.goto('/onboarding');

  // WHEN: User completes Step 1 - User Type Selection
  await page.click('[data-testid="user-type-solo"]');
  await page.click('[data-testid="onboarding-next-button"]');

  // THEN: User is redirected to dashboard with created workspace
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="workspace-name"]')).toHaveText(
    'My First Workspace'
  );
});
```

**Use as Reference**: This BDD organization should be the standard for all E2E
tests in the project.

### 2. Perfect Fixture Architecture with mergeTests

**Location**: `merged.fixture.ts` **Pattern**: Composable Fixtures **Knowledge
Base**:
[fixture-architecture.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/fixture-architecture.md)

**Why This Is Good**: Uses mergeTests pattern to compose multiple fixture sets
instead of inheritance, following the pure function → fixture → mergeTests
pattern perfectly.

**Code Example**:

```typescript
// ✅ Excellent pattern demonstrated in merged.fixture.ts
import { mergeTests } from '@playwright/test';
import { test as authTest } from './auth.fixture';
import { test as workspaceTest } from './workspace.fixture';

// Compose all fixtures for comprehensive capabilities
export const test = mergeTests(authTest, workspaceTest);
```

**Use as Reference**: This composability pattern should be the standard for all
test fixture organization.

### 3. Auto-Cleanup Fixtures with Perfect Isolation

**Location**: `auth.fixture.ts:156-185` **Pattern**: Resource Management
**Knowledge Base**:
[fixture-architecture.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/fixture-architecture.md)

**Why This Is Good**: Each fixture tracks created resources and automatically
cleans them up after test completion, preventing test pollution.

**Code Example**:

```typescript
// ✅ Excellent pattern demonstrated in auth.fixture.ts
authenticatedUser: async ({ request }, use) => {
  // Setup: Create user and profile
  const { user, token } = await createUserViaAPI(request, user);

  // Provide to test
  await use({ user, profile, token });

  // Cleanup: Delete user
  await deleteUserViaAPI(request, createdUser.id, token);
};
```

**Use as Reference**: All fixtures should follow this setup → use → cleanup
pattern.
