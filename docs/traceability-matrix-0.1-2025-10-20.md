**Key Evidence:**
- **Complete Coverage**: All 6 P0 acceptance criteria have FULL coverage across multiple test levels
- **Quality Excellence**: 2,518 lines of well-structured tests with proper BDD format, fixtures, and data factories
- **Performance Validation**: 60-second setup SLA and 5-second health check requirements explicitly tested
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios with clear troubleshooting guidance validated
- **No Critical Issues**: Zero security vulnerabilities, test quality issues, or coverage gaps

**Assessment:**
The development environment setup functionality is ready for production deployment. The test suite provides excellent confidence in the setup script's ability to reliably configure development environments across all supported platforms with the required tools and services.
