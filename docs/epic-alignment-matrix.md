## Summary

**Total Epics:** 5 **Total Stories:** 41-51 **Technical Readiness:** 100% ✅
**Architecture Coverage:** Complete

## Key Insights

1. **All epics have solid technical foundation** in proposed architecture
2. **Microservices alignment** ensures clean separation of concerns
3. **Shared types** guarantee integration consistency across services
4. **Real-time capabilities** address core wait-time optimization requirements
5. **Enterprise features** properly architected with security-first approach

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Items:**

- Core functionality (FRs mapped to services)
- Performance requirements (Bun + Redis architecture)
- UI requirements (Three-column layout system)

**Medium Risk Items:**

- AI provider integration complexity (multiple APIs to integrate)
- Real-time synchronization at scale (10K+ concurrent users)
- Enterprise SSO integration (various SAML/OIDC providers)

**Recommendations:**

1. Prioritize Epic 1 for core value delivery
2. Implement comprehensive testing for real-time features
3. Establish AI provider integration patterns early
4. Plan load testing for 10K+ concurrent users
