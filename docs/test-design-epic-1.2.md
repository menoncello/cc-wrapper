## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. Bun Web Crypto API is stable and production-ready for encryption operations
2. Zustand state management patterns established in Story 1.1b are reusable
3. Database can handle JSONB storage of compressed session data efficiently
4. Performance targets (<100ms save, <500ms restore) are achievable with current infrastructure

### Dependencies

1. Authentication service completion for user session linking - Required by 2025-11-01
2. AI orchestration service for conversation history persistence - Required by 2025-11-15
3. Database migration tools for session schema deployment - Required by 2025-10-30

### Risks to Plan

- **Risk**: Bun Web Crypto API may have unexpected limitations or security vulnerabilities
  - **Impact**: Could require complete reimplementation of encryption layer
  - **Contingency**: Fallback to Node.js crypto module with equivalent security guarantees

- **Risk**: Session state complexity may exceed serialization capabilities
  - **Impact**: Performance degradation or data loss during state capture
  - **Contingency**: Implement state segmentation and selective persistence strategies
