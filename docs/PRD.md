## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

Based on the comprehensive research findings, here are the strategic goals for CC Wrapper:

- **Productivity Optimization**: Reduce AI wait time productivity losses by 60% through parallel task orchestration and contextual work recommendations
- **Multi-AI Integration**: Provide unified interface for managing multiple AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot) with seamless context switching
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Implement role-based access control, audit logging, and compliance standards for enterprise adoption
- **Cost Management**: Reduce AI tool spending by 30% through intelligent usage optimization and shared resource management
- **Developer Experience**: Create intuitive hybrid TUI/web interface that matches terminal workflow patterns while providing modern web capabilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support 10,000+ concurrent users with container-per-project isolation and real-time synchronization

### Background Context

CC Wrapper addresses the critical productivity crisis in AI-assisted development where developers spend 89% of AI wait time unproductively context switching between tools. With the AI developer productivity tools market projected to reach $13.8B by 2025 (34.2% CAGR), and enterprises using an average of 2+ AI tools, there's an urgent need for an orchestration layer that eliminates workflow friction.

Current solutions force developers into single-tool ecosystems or require managing multiple disconnected interfaces, resulting in $2.1B annual productivity losses. CC Wrapper's hybrid TUI/web approach leverages terminal familiarity while providing modern web capabilities, targeting the $890M SAM for AI orchestration platforms with a realistic $31.2M SOM.

The platform's unique wait time optimization represents a first-to-market innovation, positioning CC Wrapper as the integration-first orchestration platform that bridges the gap between terminal-based workflows and modern AI-powered development environments.

**Enhanced Epic Sequencing Strategy:**
Based on pre-mortem analysis, the revised epic sequence addresses key failure modes:

1. **Value-First Delivery**: Epic 1 now focuses on wait-time optimization and immediate productivity benefits
2. **Trust Building Early**: Epic 2 front-loads enterprise security features to accelerate adoption
3. **Managed Complexity**: Each epic includes complexity management and progressive disclosure
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Success metrics and go/no-go criteria built into each epic

**Revised MVP Definition:**
**MVP (Epics 1-2):** Delivers core wait-time optimization with basic enterprise security - demonstrates immediate value while building trust for enterprise adoption.

**Full Product (Epics 1-5):** Complete hybrid TUI/web experience with enterprise-grade features, analytics, and platform expansion capabilities.

**Key Risk Mitigation Checkpoints:**
- After Epic 1: User retention and productivity value validation
- After Epic 2: Enterprise pilot readiness and security validation
- After Epic 3: Team collaboration adoption and scalability validation
- After Epic 4: Analytics engagement and cost optimization validation
- After Epic 5: Cross-platform satisfaction and ecosystem readiness

## Out of Scope

**Strategic Scope Boundaries** - What we're intentionally NOT doing in this version to maintain focus and deliver value faster

Based on our comprehensive analysis including risk assessment, stakeholder input, and pre-mortem insights, here are the items explicitly excluded from CC Wrapper v1.0:

### **AI Model Development**
- **Custom AI Model Training**: We will not develop proprietary AI models
- **On-Premise AI Infrastructure**: No local AI model hosting or management
- **AI Model Fine-Tuning**: No customization of existing AI models
- **Rationale**: Focus on orchestration layer rather than AI development; faster time-to-market; leverages existing AI ecosystem

### **Full IDE Replacement**
- **Code Editor/IDE Functionality**: No built-in code editing, syntax highlighting, or debugging
- **Version Control Integration**: No direct Git operations or version management
- **Build System Integration**: No direct compilation, testing, or deployment pipelines
- **Rationale**: Avoids competing with established IDEs; reduces complexity; maintains tool-agnostic approach

### **Mobile-First Applications**
- **Native Mobile Apps**: No iOS or Android applications
- **Mobile-First Interface**: Interface optimized for mobile primary usage
- **Mobile-Specific Features**: No camera, GPS, or mobile hardware integrations
- **Rationale**: Desktop/laptop is primary development environment; mobile support via responsive web interface

### **Enterprise Platform Features**
- **Advanced Compliance Frameworks**: No HIPAA, FINRA, or industry-specific compliance modules
- **Advanced IAM Integration**: No complex identity federation beyond basic SSO
- **Enterprise Resource Planning**: No integration with ERP systems or advanced budgeting
- **Rationale**: Focus on core developer productivity; enterprise features can be added in v2.0 based on market demand

### **Advanced Collaboration Features**
- **Real-Time Co-Editing**: No simultaneous editing of code or documents
- **Video/Communication Integration**: No built-in video calls, chat, or communication tools
- **Advanced Project Management**: No Gantt charts, resource allocation, or project portfolio management
- **Rationale**: Avoids scope creep; integrates with existing tools rather than replacing them

### **Extensive Customization & Theming**
- **Plugin System**: No third-party plugin or extension ecosystem
- **Advanced Theming Engine**: No custom CSS, advanced branding, or extensive visual customization
- **Workflow Automation**: No custom scripting, macros, or advanced workflow automation
- **Rationale**: Maintains simplicity; reduces maintenance overhead; focuses on core value proposition

### **Platform Expansion**
- **Operating System Applications**: No native Windows, macOS, or Linux desktop applications
- **Browser Extensions**: No Chrome, Firefox, or other browser extensions
- **API Platform**: No public API, developer platform, or ecosystem marketplace
- **Rationale**: Web-based approach provides cross-platform compatibility; native apps can be considered for v2.0

### **Future Considerations (Version 2.0+)**
**High-Priority for Future Versions:**
- Native desktop applications (Tauri/Electron)
- Advanced compliance frameworks for regulated industries
- Plugin ecosystem for third-party integrations
- Advanced team collaboration features

**Medium-Priority for Future Versions:**
- Mobile applications with offline capabilities
- Custom AI model fine-tuning capabilities
- Advanced project management integrations
- Industry-specific compliance modules

**Strategic Rationale:**
The out-of-scope items are intentionally excluded to:
1. **Accelerate Time-to-Market**: Focus on core value proposition (wait-time optimization)
2. **Manage Complexity**: Prevent feature bloat and maintain product simplicity
3. **Reduce Risk**: Avoid competing with established players in adjacent markets
4. **Enable Learning**: Gather user feedback before expanding into adjacent areas
5. **Maintain Focus**: Stay true to the core mission of AI tool orchestration

**Scope Evolution Strategy:**
Future scope expansion will be driven by:
- User feedback and usage patterns
- Market demand and competitive landscape
- Technical capabilities and resource availability
- Strategic partnerships and ecosystem opportunities
