- Performance testing against 60-second SLA requirement
- Comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting validation
- Proper temporary directory management with cleanup

**Issue:**
- Exceeds 300-line guideline (419 lines) - should be split into focused modules

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix): **NONE**

No critical issues found. All tests demonstrate robust engineering practices with proper isolation, deterministic design, and comprehensive validation.

---

## Recommendations (Should Fix)

### 1. Split Large Test Files (P1 - High Priority)

**setup-workflow.test.ts** (419 lines) → Split into:
- `setup-performance.test.ts` - Performance and SLA validation
- `setup-integration.test.ts` - Core workflow integration
- `setup-error-handling.test.ts` - Error scenarios and troubleshooting

**setup.test.ts** (395 lines) → Split into:
- `setup-platform-detection.test.ts` - Platform validation
- `setup-dependencies.test.ts` - Dependency version checking
- `setup-configuration.test.ts` - Environment and editor setup

### 2. Implement Data Factories (P2 - Medium Priority)

Create factory functions for test data:

```typescript
// test-utils/factories/setup-factory.ts
export const createMockSetupEnvironment = (overrides = {}) => ({
  REQUIRED_VERSIONS: {
    bun: '1.3.0',
    typescript: '5.9.3',
    docker: '28.5.1',
    postgresql: '18.0',
    redis: '8.2.2'
  },
  ...overrides
});

export const createMockHealthCheck = (overrides = {}) => ({
  status: 'healthy',
  responseTime: 100,
  message: 'All systems operational',
  ...overrides
});
```

### 3. Extract Common Fixtures (P2 - Medium Priority)

Create reusable fixtures for common setup:

```typescript
// test-utils/fixtures/setup-fixtures.ts
export const setupTestEnvironment = () => {
  // Mock console methods
  // Create temp directories
  // Set up test environment
};

export const cleanupTestEnvironment = () => {
  // Restore console methods
  // Clean up temp directories
  // Reset environment variables
};
```

---

## Best Practices Examples

**Excellent Test ID Structure:**
```typescript
test('1.1-E2E-001: should detect macOS platform correctly', () => {
  // Clear mapping to Story 1.1, E2E test #001
});
```

**Perfect Priority Classification:**
```typescript
describe('Platform Detection - P0 Critical Core Functionality', () => {
  // Clear priority indicator for test importance
});
```

**Comprehensive Performance Testing:**
```typescript
test('3.1-E2E-001: should complete setup within 60 seconds', async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  // ... test logic
  expect(duration).toBeLessThan(60000); // SLA validation
}, 65000);
```

**Excellent Isolation and Cleanup:**
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  console.log = mock(() => {});
  console.error = mock(() => {});
});

afterEach(() => {
  console.log = originalConsoleLog;
  console.error = originalConsoleError;
});
```
