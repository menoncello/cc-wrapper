## Running Tests

### Run all tests for Story 0.2

```bash
# Run all integration tests
bun test tests/integration/

# Run all E2E tests (requires Playwright configured first)
bun test tests/e2e/

# Run complete test suite
bun test
```

### Run specific test files

```bash
# Monorepo structure tests
bun test tests/integration/monorepo-structure.test.ts

# Build system tests
bun test tests/integration/build-system.test.ts

# Test framework tests
bun test tests/integration/test-framework.test.ts

# Code quality tests
bun test tests/integration/code-quality.test.ts

# Development scripts tests
bun test tests/integration/dev-scripts.test.ts

# Documentation tests
bun test tests/integration/documentation.test.ts

# CI pipeline tests (Playwright)
bun test tests/e2e/ci-pipeline.test.ts

# Complete workflow tests (Playwright)
bun test tests/e2e/complete-dev-workflow.test.ts
```

### Run tests in headed mode (for Playwright E2E tests)

```bash
bunx playwright test tests/e2e/ --headed
```

### Debug specific test

```bash
bunx playwright test tests/e2e/ci-pipeline.test.ts --debug
```

### Run tests with coverage

```bash
bun test --coverage
```

## Red-Green-Refactor Workflow

### RED Phase (Complete) ✅

**TEA Agent Responsibilities:**

- ✅ All tests written and failing (115+ tests total)
- ✅ Test utilities created for common operations
- ✅ Implementation checklist created with clear tasks
- ✅ Tests organized by acceptance criteria
- ✅ Performance requirements documented

**Verification:**

```bash
# Run integration tests (most will fail - expected!)
bun test tests/integration/

# Check failing tests count
bun test tests/integration/ 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAIL|PASS)"
```

- All tests run and fail as expected
- Failure messages are clear and actionable
- Tests fail due to missing implementation, not test bugs

---

### GREEN Phase (DEV Team - Next Steps)

**DEV Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **Pick one failing test** from implementation checklist (start with AC1)
2. **Read the test** to understand expected behavior
3. **Implement minimal code** to make that specific test pass
4. **Run the test** to verify it now passes (green)
5. **Check off the task** in implementation checklist
6. **Move to next test** and repeat

**Key Principles:**

- One test at a time (don't try to fix all at once)
- Minimal implementation (don't over-engineer)
- Run tests frequently (immediate feedback)
- Use implementation checklist as roadmap

**Recommended Implementation Order:**

1. **Start with AC1** (Monorepo Structure) - Foundation
2. **Then AC6** (Development Scripts) - Enables workflow
3. **Then AC2** (Build System) - Core functionality
4. **Then AC3** (Test Framework) - Quality foundation
5. **Then AC4** (Code Quality) - Standards enforcement
6. **Then AC7** (Documentation) - Knowledge sharing
7. **Finally AC5** (CI/CD) - Automation

**Progress Tracking:**

- Check off tasks as you complete them
- Share progress in daily standup
- Update story status in `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`

---

### REFACTOR Phase (DEV Team - After All Tests Pass)

**DEV Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **Verify all tests pass** (green phase complete)
2. **Review code for quality** (readability, maintainability, performance)
3. **Extract duplications** (DRY principle)
4. **Optimize performance** (if needed)
5. **Ensure tests still pass** after each refactor
6. **Update documentation** (if needed)

**Key Principles:**

- Tests provide safety net (refactor with confidence)
- Make small refactors (easier to debug if tests fail)
- Run tests after each change
- Don't change test behavior (only implementation)

**Completion:**

- All tests pass
- Code quality meets team standards
- No duplications or code smells
- Performance targets met (build < 30s, tests < 2min)
- Ready for code review and story approval

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this checklist** with team in standup or planning
2. **Run failing tests** to confirm RED phase:
   ```bash
   bun test tests/integration/
   ```
3. **Begin implementation** using implementation checklist as guide
4. **Work one test at a time** (red → green for each)
5. **Share progress** in daily standup
6. **When all tests pass**, refactor code for quality
7. **When refactoring complete**, update story status to DONE in
   `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`

## Test Execution Evidence

### Initial Test Run (RED Phase Verification)

**Command:** `bun test tests/integration/`

**Expected Results:**

- **Total tests:** ~90 integration tests + ~25 E2E tests = ~115 tests
- **Passing:** 20-30 tests (existing infrastructure that's already in place)
- **Failing:** 85-95 tests (expected - implementation pending)
- **Status:** ✅ RED phase verified

**Expected Failure Categories:**

- **Missing files:** Configuration files not created yet (playwright.config.ts,
  vite.config.ts, etc.)
- **Missing directories:** Workspace directories not created yet (packages/,
  services/, apps/)
- **Missing dependencies:** Packages not installed yet (Husky, lint-staged,
  Stryker, Vite 7)
- **Missing scripts:** Package.json scripts not added yet
- **Missing documentation:** Documentation files not created yet
- **Missing workflows:** GitHub Actions workflows not created yet

---

## Performance Requirements

All acceptance criteria must meet these performance targets:

- **Build time:** < 30 seconds (AC2)
- **Test execution:** < 2 minutes for full suite (AC3)
- **Developer setup:** < 5 minutes from clone to running (All ACs)
- **CI pipeline:** < 5 minutes for complete validation (AC5)
- **Hot reload (frontend):** < 200ms (AC2)
- **Hot reload (backend):** < 1s (AC2)

---

## Knowledge Base References Applied

This ATDD workflow consulted the following knowledge fragments:

- **test-levels-framework.md** - Test level selection (Integration vs E2E for
  infrastructure)
- **test-quality.md** - Test design principles (Given-When-Then, deterministic,
  isolated)
- **fixture-architecture.md** - Test utilities and helper patterns
- **data-factories.md** - Test data generation (adapted for infrastructure
  testing)

---

## Notes

### Infrastructure Testing Approach

Story 0.2 is unique because it's about **setting up the test framework itself**.
This creates a bootstrapping scenario:

- **Bun:test** is used for integration tests (already available)
- **Playwright E2E tests** will run once `playwright.config.ts` is created (AC3)
- Tests verify file system, configuration, and command execution
- No traditional user data factories needed - using test utilities instead

### User Preferences Applied

- **Zero ESLint disable comments:** Tests enforce this
  (code-quality.test.ts:174)
- **Mutation testing thresholds:** Never lower to pass
  (test-framework.test.ts:160)
- **English for code/docs:** All artifacts in English
- **TypeScript strict mode:** Enforced in tests (code-quality.test.ts:104)

### Bootstrap Consideration

Since this story creates the test infrastructure, some tests are **meta-tests**
(tests that verify the test framework setup). This is intentional and expected.
