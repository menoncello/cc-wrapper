# Story 0.1: Development Environment Setup

Status: Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to run a setup script that automatically configures the
complete development environment, so that I have all dependencies, tools, and
services ready for productive development within 60 seconds.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Developer can run setup script and have fully configured development
   environment within 60 seconds
2. All required development tools are installed and configured with correct
   versions (Bun 1.3.0, TypeScript 5.9.3, Docker 28.5.1, PostgreSQL 18.0, Redis
   8.2.2)
3. Development services start successfully and pass health checks within 5
   seconds
4. Code editor configuration is applied automatically (VS Code extensions and
   settings)
5. Environment variables are properly configured and validated
6. Documentation provides clear troubleshooting guidance for common setup issues

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Notes

- **Monorepo Structure**: Follow established apps/, packages/, services/ layout
  from solution architecture [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#Proposed
  Source Tree]
- **Runtime Strategy**: Bun-exclusive for maximum performance and simplicity
  [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#Bun-Only Architecture Strategy]
- **Container Integration**: Docker development environment matching production
  patterns [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Dependencies and Integrations]

### Architecture Alignment

- **Technology Stack**: Bun 1.3.0, TypeScript 5.9.3, Docker 28.5.1 as specified
  in architecture [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#Technology and Library
  Decision Table]
- **Performance Requirements**: 60-second setup target from Epic 0 performance
  specifications [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Performance Requirements]
- **Health Check System**: Follow established health check interface patterns
  [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#APIs and Interfaces]

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Use Bun Test for configuration validation and CLI commands
  [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Test Strategy Summary]
- **Integration Tests**: Service health checks and build system validation
- **E2E Tests**: Complete setup workflow automation testing
- **Performance Tests**: Setup timing verification (target: <60 seconds)
