# Story 1.2: Session Persistence & Recovery

Status: done

## Story

As a developer,
I want my work sessions to be automatically saved and recoverable with encrypted storage,
So that I can resume work exactly where I left off after restarts or interruptions while maintaining data security and privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System automatically saves workspace state every 30 seconds with encrypted storage
2. Session captures terminal state, browser tabs, AI conversation history, and open files using established state patterns
3. User can resume work exactly where left off after restart using Zustand state restoration
4. System detects and recovers from corrupted sessions with minimal data loss using validation patterns
5. User can manually create session checkpoints and restore from any checkpoint via API endpoints
6. Session data encrypted at rest with user-controlled encryption keys using Bun Web Crypto API

## Dev Notes

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 1.1b (Status: Done)**

- **New State Management Pattern**: Zustand stores established for onboarding and tour state management - use `apps/web/src/stores/sessionStore.ts` following same patterns for session state
- **Bun Web Crypto API Integration**: Proven for authentication (JWT, Argon2id) - adapt for session encryption key management using same `crypto.subtle` patterns
- **Elysia Framework Patterns**: API endpoint structure, middleware patterns, Zod validation established - follow same patterns for session endpoints (`/api/sessions/*`)
- **React Island Architecture**: Astro + React islands for interactive components - create session management islands for session UI components
- **Performance Testing Framework**: Now enabled and operational - use for session performance validation (target: <100ms save, <500ms restore)
- **Security Scanning Pipeline**: Comprehensive SAST/DAST pipeline configured - available for session security validation
- **Database Patterns**: Prisma ORM with migrations, following auth service patterns - extend existing schema with session models
- **Testing Strategy**: Bun Test for unit/integration, Playwright 1.56.0 for E2E - follow same testing patterns for session features

### Architecture Patterns

- **State Management**: Use immutable state patterns with JSON serialization
- **Incremental Updates**: Implement diff-based saving to reduce storage overhead
- **Compression**: Apply state compression for large workspace states
- **Background Processing**: Use worker threads for session serialization to avoid UI blocking

### Technical Constraints

- Session size limit: 50MB per session (compressed)
- Auto-save interval: 30 seconds with user-configurable options
- Retention policy: 30 days for automatic sessions, 90 days for checkpoints
- Performance targets: <100ms for session save, <500ms for session restore

### Security Requirements

- Session encryption using AES-256-GCM with user-derived keys
- Keys derived from user password using Argon2id (memoryCost: 65536, timeCost: 3)
- No plaintext session data stored at rest
- Secure key storage using Bun Web Crypto API

### Project Structure Notes

Following established monorepo structure from Story 1.1a:

**Session Service Location**: `services/session/`
- Align with `services/auth/` structure from previous story
- Use same Bun + Elysia stack for consistency
- Follow same testing patterns with Bun Test
- Use shared types from `packages/shared-types/`

**Database Integration**:
- Extend existing Prisma schema with session models
- Reuse database connection patterns from auth service
- Follow same migration patterns and conventions

**API Design Alignment**:
- Follow same REST API patterns as authentication endpoints
- Use same error handling and response formats
- Implement same rate limiting and security middleware
- Use same Zod validation patterns

### Dependencies and Integration Points

**Authentication Service**:
- User identification for session ownership
- JWT token validation for session access
- User profile data for session metadata

**Workspace Service** (future story):
- Project context for session organization
- Workspace sharing permissions for session access
- Project templates for session initialization

**AI Orchestration Service** (future story):
- Conversation history persistence
- AI context preservation across sessions
- Wait-time optimization state recovery

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Persistence Engine** - Database schema and basic save/restore
2. **State Serialization** - Efficient workspace state capture and compression
3. **Recovery Logic** - Corruption detection and repair mechanisms
4. **Security Layer** - Encryption and key management
5. **Integration Points** - Connect to existing services
6. **Performance Optimization** - Incremental updates and caching
