# Story 6.3: Determinism Improvements

Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want to eliminate try-catch flow control and improve test determinism,
so that tests have predictable outcomes and consistent behavior across executions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Try-catch flow control eliminated from all test files
2. Process manipulation and external dependencies properly mocked
3. Test isolation implemented to prevent cross-test interference
4. Deterministic test execution patterns established
5. Error handling replaced with explicit assertions and proper mocking
6. Documentation provided for deterministic testing best practices

  - [ ] Audit test files for try-catch flow control usage
  - [ ] Identify process manipulation and external dependencies
  - [ ] Catalog all sources of test indeterminism

  - [ ] Refactor `cli-commands.test.ts` to use explicit assertions
  - [ ] Mock command execution errors properly
  - [ ] Implement proper error scenario testing without try-catch
- [ ] Replace try-catch flow control in platform detection tests (AC: #1, #5)
  - [ ] Refactor `platform-detection.test.ts` error handling
  - [ ] Mock platform detection failures explicitly
  - [ ] Use assertion-based error validation
- [ ] Implement proper process mocking (AC: #2, #4)
  - [ ] Create process mocking utilities in test-utils
  - [ ] Replace direct process manipulation with mocked equivalents
  - [ ] Ensure consistent mock behavior across test runs
- [ ] Implement test isolation mechanisms (AC: #3, #4)
  - [ ] Add proper cleanup between test cases
  - [ ] Isolate file system operations and temporary resources
  - [ ] Prevent shared state between test cases
- [ ] Update E2E tests for determinism (AC: #1, #3, #5)
  - [ ] Refactor `setup-workflow.e2e.test.ts` error handling
  - [ ] Implement deterministic wait strategies
  - [ ] Replace timing-dependent assertions with explicit conditions
- [ ] Add deterministic testing documentation (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Create deterministic testing guidelines in test-utils README
  - [ ] Document proper mocking strategies for external dependencies
  - [ ] Provide examples of deterministic error testing patterns

## Dev Notes

### Current Determinism Issues (from test-review.md):
- Try-catch blocks used for flow control in 2 locations
- Process manipulation without proper mocking
- Potential test interference from shared resources
- Timing-dependent assertions in E2E tests

### Target Architecture:
Based on solution-architecture.md testing strategy:
- **Deterministic Unit Tests**: Pure functions with mocked dependencies
- **Deterministic Integration Tests**: Isolated environments with controlled inputs
- **Deterministic E2E Tests**: Explicit conditions instead of timing dependencies
- **Error Testing**: Explicit assertions instead of exception handling

### Project Structure Notes

**Determinism Utilities Location**:
```
packages/test-utils/src/determinism/
├── index.ts                    # Determinism utilities exports
├── process-mocks.ts           # Process mocking utilities
├── isolation-helpers.ts       # Test isolation utilities
├── assertion-helpers.ts       # Enhanced assertion patterns
└── timing-helpers.ts          # Deterministic timing utilities
```

**Test Refactoring Pattern**:
```typescript
// Before (non-deterministic)
try {
  const result = await executeCommand(cmd)
  expect(result.success).toBe(true)
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error
}

// After (deterministic)
const mockProcess = createProcessMock()
mockProcess.setup(cmd, { success: true })
const result = await executeCommand(cmd)
expect(result.success).toBe(true)
expect(mockProcess.calledWith(cmd)).toBe(true)
```

### Determinism Principles

1. **No Exception Flow Control**: Use explicit assertions and mocked scenarios
2. **Isolated Test Environments**: Each test runs in clean, predictable state
3. **Controlled External Dependencies**: All external interactions mocked
4. **Explicit Conditions**: Replace timing dependencies with explicit state checks
5. **Consistent Mock Behavior**: Same mock setup produces identical results
