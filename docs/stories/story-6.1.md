# Story 6.1: Data Factory Implementation

Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want to replace hardcoded test data with reusable factory functions,
so that tests are more maintainable, consistent, and safer for parallel execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Factory functions created for all test data types (versions, configurations, user data, platform data)
2. Tests updated to use factory functions instead of hardcoded values
3. Factory functions support overrides for custom test scenarios
4. Type safety maintained for all factory-generated data
5. Test data isolation ensured for parallel test execution
6. Documentation provided for factory usage and patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create factory foundation and base types (AC: #1, #4)
  - [ ] Set up `packages/test-utils/src/factories/` directory structure
  - [ ] Create base factory interface and generic factory builder
  - [ ] Define TypeScript types for all test data entities
- [ ] Implement version configuration factory (AC: #1, #3)
  - [ ] Create `version-factory.ts` with default version configurations
  - [ ] Support override mechanism for custom version testing
  - [ ] Add validation for version format and compatibility
- [ ] Implement user and authentication data factories (AC: #1, #3, #5)
  - [ ] Create `user-factory.ts` with test user templates
  - [ ] Support different user roles and permission levels
  - [ ] Ensure unique user generation for parallel test safety
- [ ] Implement platform and environment data factories (AC: #1, #3)
  - [ ] Create `platform-factory.ts` for OS and platform test data
  - [ ] Create `environment-factory.ts` for test environment configurations
  - [ ] Support cross-platform testing scenarios
- [ ] Update existing tests to use factories (AC: #2, #6)
  - [ ] Refactor `cli-commands.test.ts` to use version factory
  - [ ] Refactor `platform-detection.test.ts` to use platform factory
  - [ ] Refactor `environment-validation.test.ts` to use environment factory
  - [ ] Refactor `setup-workflow.e2e.test.ts` to use multiple factories
- [ ] Add factory documentation and examples (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Create factory usage documentation in test-utils README
  - [ ] Provide examples for custom factory creation
  - [ ] Document best practices for test data management

## Dev Notes

### Current Test Data Issues (from test-review.md):
- Hardcoded version numbers in multiple test files
- Repeated platform detection setup code
- No centralization of test data generation
- Potential test data conflicts in parallel execution

### Target Architecture:
Based on solution-architecture.md testing strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Bun Test with factory-generated data
- **Integration Tests**: Isolated test environments with synthetic data
- **E2E Tests**: Fresh environment simulation using factory data
- **Data Strategy**: Synthetic test data only, no production data usage

### Project Structure Notes

**Factory Location**:
```
packages/test-utils/src/factories/
├── index.ts          # Factory exports
├── base/             # Base factory utilities
│   ├── factory.ts    # Generic factory builder
│   └── types.ts      # Base factory interfaces
├── version-factory.ts
├── user-factory.ts
├── platform-factory.ts
└── environment-factory.ts
```

**Integration Points**:
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests using factories
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests with factory data
- `tests/e2e/` - E2E tests using factory for environment setup
- `packages/test-utils/` - Factory distribution and reuse
