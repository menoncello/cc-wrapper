## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Notes

- **Monorepo Layout**: Follow the architecture pattern with clear separation:
  apps/ (frontend), services/ (backend microservices), packages/ (shared
  libraries) [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#System Architecture Alignment]
- **Workspace Management**: Use Bun workspaces for dependency management and
  build optimization across the monorepo [Source:
  docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Technology Stack Foundation]
- **Build Strategy**: Vite 7.0.0 for frontend with Astro + React, individual
  TypeScript compilation for each backend service [Source:
  docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Build and Deployment Alignment]

### Architecture Alignment

- **Technology Stack**: Bun 1.3.0 runtime, TypeScript 5.9.3 strict mode, Vite
  7.0.0 build system [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Technology Stack
  Foundation]
- **Testing Framework**: Bun Test for unit/integration tests, Playwright 1.56.0
  for E2E tests, Stryker for mutation testing [Source:
  docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Development Environment Support]
- **Quality Standards**: ESLint with TypeScript, Prettier formatting, zero
  tolerance for linting violations [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Build and
  Deployment Alignment]
- **Performance Targets**: Build time < 30 seconds, hot reload < 200ms frontend
  / < 1s backend [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Performance]

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: 90% code coverage target using Bun Test with coverage
  reporting [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-0.md#Test Levels and Frameworks]
- **Integration Tests**: Service health checks, build system validation,
  inter-service communication
- **E2E Tests**: Complete development workflow automation using Playwright
- **Performance Tests**: Build timing < 30s, test execution < 2 minutes
- **Mutation Tests**: Stryker mutation testing for test quality validation

### Code Quality Requirements

- **ESLint Configuration**: Zero inline disable comments allowed per user
  preferences [Source: /Users/menoncello/.claude/CLAUDE.md]
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full strict type checking enabled across all
  services
- **Prettier Formatting**: Consistent code style enforced automatically
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks before commits
- **Mutation Testing**: Maintain high mutation score thresholds, never lower to
  pass tests [Source: /Users/menoncello/.claude/CLAUDE.md]

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build, test, lint, and deployment workflows
- **Quality Gates**: All tests must pass, zero linting errors, successful builds
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tests and builds in parallel for faster feedback
- **Branch Protection**: Require passing checks before merge
- **Status Notifications**: Automated notifications for build/test failures
