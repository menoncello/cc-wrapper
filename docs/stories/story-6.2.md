# Story 6.2: Fixture Architecture Implementation

Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want to extract common test setup code into reusable fixtures,
so that tests are more maintainable, follow DRY principles, and have consistent setup patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Common test setup patterns extracted into reusable fixtures
2. Fixture system supports beforeAll/afterAll and beforeEach/afterEach hooks
3. Fixtures created for console mocking, platform detection, and environment preparation
4. Fixture composition supported for complex test scenarios
5. Fixture lifecycle management ensures proper cleanup and isolation
6. Documentation provided for fixture creation and usage patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create fixture foundation and base architecture (AC: #1, #2)
  - [ ] Set up `packages/test-utils/src/fixtures/` directory structure
  - [ ] Create base fixture interface and lifecycle management
  - [ ] Implement fixture registry and dependency resolution
- [ ] Implement console mocking fixture (AC: #3, #5)
  - [ ] Create `console-fixture.ts` for consistent console mocking
  - [ ] Support both spy and mock patterns for console methods
  - [ ] Ensure proper restoration of original console methods
- [ ] Implement platform detection fixture (AC: #3, #4, #5)
  - [ ] Create `platform-fixture.ts` for platform detection testing
  - [ ] Support different OS/platform simulation scenarios
  - [ ] Handle platform-specific cleanup and restoration
- [ ] Implement environment preparation fixture (AC: #3, #5)
  - [ ] Create `environment-fixture.ts` for test environment setup
  - [ ] Handle environment variable management and cleanup
  - [ ] Support temporary directory creation and cleanup
- [ ] Implement service mocking fixture (AC: #3, #4, #5)
  - [ ] Create `service-fixture.ts` for external service mocking
  - [ ] Support HTTP interceptors and mock responses
  - [ ] Ensure proper mock cleanup and isolation
- [ ] Update existing tests to use fixtures (AC: #1, #6)
  - [ ] Refactor `cli-commands.test.ts` to use console and environment fixtures
  - [ ] Refactor `platform-detection.test.ts` to use platform fixture
  - [ ] Refactor `setup-workflow.e2e.test.ts` to use multiple composed fixtures
  - [ ] Remove duplicated setup code from all test files
- [ ] Add fixture documentation and examples (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Create fixture usage documentation in test-utils README
  - [ ] Provide examples for custom fixture creation
  - [ ] Document fixture composition patterns and best practices

## Dev Notes

### Current Fixture Issues (from test-review.md):
- Repeated console mocking setup across multiple test files
- Duplicated platform detection preparation code
- No centralized cleanup mechanisms for test environments
- Inconsistent test setup patterns across the test suite

### Target Architecture:
Based on solution-architecture.md testing strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Lightweight fixtures for fast setup/teardown
- **Integration Tests**: Complex fixtures with service mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Environment fixtures for complete setup simulation
- **Fixture Lifecycle**: Automatic cleanup and resource management

### Project Structure Notes

**Fixture Location**:
```
packages/test-utils/src/fixtures/
├── index.ts              # Fixture exports
├── base/                 # Base fixture utilities
│   ├── fixture.ts        # Base fixture class
│   ├── registry.ts       # Fixture registry system
│   └── lifecycle.ts      # Lifecycle management
├── console-fixture.ts    # Console mocking fixture
├── platform-fixture.ts   # Platform detection fixture
├── environment-fixture.ts # Environment setup fixture
└── service-fixture.ts    # Service mocking fixture
```

**Fixture Integration Points**:
- `tests/unit/` - Simple fixtures for unit test setup
- `tests/integration/` - Complex fixtures with service dependencies
- `tests/e2e/` - Environment fixtures for complete workflow testing
- `packages/test-utils/` - Fixture distribution and composition utilities

**Fixture Composition Pattern**:
```typescript
// Example of fixture composition
const testSuite = useFixtures({
  console: ConsoleFixture,
  platform: PlatformFixture,
  environment: EnvironmentFixture
})
```
