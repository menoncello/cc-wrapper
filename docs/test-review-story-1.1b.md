## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

No critical issues detected. ✅

---

## Recommendations (Should Fix)

### 1. Use Data Factories for Test Data (Multiple locations)

**Severity**: P3 (Low) **Location**: Various test files **Criterion**: Data
Factories **Knowledge Base**:
[data-factories.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/data-factories.md)

**Issue Description**: Some tests use hardcoded strings for test data instead of
factory functions. This creates maintenance overhead and potential for data
collisions in parallel runs.

**Current Code**:

```typescript
// ⚠️ Could be improved (current implementation)
await page.fill('[data-testid="workspace-name-input"]', 'My First Workspace');
await page.fill('[data-testid="workspace-description-input"]', 'Testing CC Wrapper');
```

**Recommended Improvement**:

```typescript
// ✅ Better approach (recommended)
import { createWorkspace } from '../factories/workspace.factory';

const workspace = createWorkspace({
  name: 'My First Workspace',
  description: 'Testing CC Wrapper',
  template: 'react'
});
```

**Benefits**: Consistent data generation, easier maintenance, prevents
collisions in parallel runs

**Priority**: Low - current approach works fine, but factories would enhance
maintainability

### 2. Add Network Response Assertions (onboarding-tour.spec.ts:16-17)

**Severity**: P3 (Low) **Location**: `tests/e2e/onboarding-tour.spec.ts:16-17`
**Criterion**: Network-First Pattern **Knowledge Base**:
[network-first.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/network-first.md)

**Issue Description**: Network interception is properly set up, but tests don't
assert on response status/body, missing an opportunity to validate API behavior.

**Current Code**:

```typescript
// ⚠️ Could be improved (current implementation)
// Network-first: Setup interception before navigation
await page.route('**/api/**', route => route.continue());
```

**Recommended Improvement**:

```typescript
// ✅ Better approach (recommended)
// Network-first: Setup interception with response validation
const apiResponse = page.waitForResponse(
  resp => resp.url().includes('/api/') && resp.status() === 200
);
await page.route('**/api/**', route => route.continue());
// Later: await expect((await apiResponse).status()).toBe(200);
```

**Benefits**: Validates API behavior, catches backend regressions earlier

**Priority**: Low - current approach works, but response assertions would
provide better coverage

### 3. Enhance Assertion Specificity (user-profile-settings.spec.ts:41-42)

**Severity**: P3 (Low) **Location**:
`tests/e2e/user-profile-settings.spec.ts:41-42` **Criterion**: Assertions
**Knowledge Base**:
[test-quality.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/test-quality.md)

**Issue Description**: Some assertions are general ("toContainText") when they
could be more specific for better error messages.

**Current Code**:

```typescript
// ⚠️ Could be improved (current implementation)
await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="selected-ai-tools"]')).toContainText('Claude');
await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="email-notifications-toggle"]')).toBeChecked();
```

**Recommended Improvement**:

```typescript
// ✅ Better approach (recommended)
await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="selected-ai-tools"]')).toHaveText('Claude'); // More specific than containText
await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="email-notifications-toggle"]')).toBeChecked(); // Already good
```

**Benefits**: More precise error messages when tests fail

**Priority**: Low - current assertions work fine, just a matter of precision

## Best Practices Found

### 1. Perfect Network-First Implementation

**Location**: `tests/e2e/onboarding-tour.spec.ts:16-17` **Pattern**:
Network-First **Knowledge Base**:
[network-first.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/network-first.md)

**Why This Is Good**: The tour tests demonstrate perfect network-first pattern -
setting up route interception BEFORE any navigation. This prevents race
conditions and ensures deterministic behavior.

**Code Example**:

```typescript
// ✅ Excellent pattern demonstrated in this test
// Network-first: Setup interception before navigation
await page.route('**/api/**', route => route.continue());

// GIVEN: User completes onboarding wizard
await page.setExtraHTTPHeaders({
  Authorization: `Bearer ${authenticatedUser.token}`
});
await page.goto('/onboarding');
```

**Use as Reference**: This pattern should be followed in all E2E tests that
involve API calls.

### 2. Excellent Fixture Composition

**Location**: `tests/fixtures/merged.fixture.ts:37` **Pattern**: mergeTests()
**Knowledge Base**:
[fixture-architecture.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/fixture-architecture.md)

**Why This Is Good**: Perfect implementation of the composability pattern from
fixture-architecture.md. Instead of inheritance, tests compose capabilities via
mergeTests(), following the pure function → Fixture → mergeTests pattern.

**Code Example**:

```typescript
// ✅ Excellent pattern demonstrated in this test
export const test = mergeTests(authTest, workspaceTest);
```

**Use as Reference**: This is the recommended pattern for composing multiple
fixture sets in the project.

### 3. Outstanding BDD Structure

**Location**: All test files **Pattern**: Given-When-Then **Knowledge Base**:
[test-quality.md](../../../testarch/knowledge/test-quality.md)

**Why This Is Good**: Every test follows clear BDD structure with descriptive
comments that make test intent immediately obvious.

**Code Example**:

```typescript
// ✅ Excellent pattern demonstrated in this test
test('should complete full onboarding wizard and create default workspace', async ({
  page,
  authenticatedUser
}) => {
  // GIVEN: Authenticated user lands on onboarding wizard
  await page.setExtraHTTPHeaders({
    Authorization: `Bearer ${authenticatedUser.token}`
  });
  await page.goto('/onboarding');

  // WHEN: User completes Step 1 - User Type Selection
  await page.click('[data-testid="user-type-solo"]');
  await page.click('[data-testid="onboarding-next-button"]');

  // AND: User completes Step 2 - AI Tools Selection
  await page.check('[data-testid="ai-tool-claude"]');
  await page.check('[data-testid="ai-tool-cursor"]');
  await page.click('[data-testid="onboarding-next-button"]');

  // THEN: User is redirected to dashboard with created workspace
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="workspace-name"]')).toHaveText('My First Workspace');
});
```

**Use as Reference**: This BDD structure should be the standard for all E2E
tests in the project.
