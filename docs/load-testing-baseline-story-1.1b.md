## Load Testing Architecture

### Test Environment Support

| Environment | URL                           | Load Level           | When to Run         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Development | http://localhost:3000         | Light (5-10 users)   | Feature development |
| Staging     | https://staging.ccwrapper.dev | Medium (25-50 users) | PR validation       |
| Production  | https://ccwrapper.dev         | Heavy (100 users)    | Release validation  |

### Performance Targets Established

| Metric                | Target                 | Measurement Point  | Status     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| API Response Time     | < 2s (95th percentile) | All endpoints      | ✅ DEFINED |
| Error Rate            | < 1%                   | All scenarios      | ✅ DEFINED |
| Onboarding Completion | < 10s                  | End-to-end flow    | ✅ DEFINED |
| Skip Flow Completion  | < 5s                   | Skip functionality | ✅ DEFINED |
| Profile Access        | < 500ms                | Profile retrieval  | ✅ DEFINED |
| Profile Update        | < 1s                   | Profile changes    | ✅ DEFINED |

### Custom Metrics Implemented

- `onboarding_duration`: Time to complete full onboarding flow
- `skip_flow_duration`: Time to complete skip onboarding flow
- `api_response_time`: Individual API endpoint response times
- `profile_access_time`: Profile retrieval performance
- `profile_update_time`: Profile update performance
- `workspace_creation_time`: Workspace API call performance
- `errors`: Business logic error rate tracking

---

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/load-testing.yml`

**Triggers:**

- Push to main/develop/story branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Daily scheduled runs (2 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch with environment/load level selection

**Environment Detection:**

- **Production branches**: Staging environment, medium load
- **Development branches**: Development environment, light load
- **Scheduled runs**: Staging environment, medium load
- **Manual runs**: User-configurable environment and load level

### Load Levels Configuration

| Load Level | Virtual Users | Duration   | Use Case             |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Light      | 5 users       | 5 minutes  | Development testing  |
| Medium     | 15 users      | 10 minutes | Staging validation   |
| Heavy      | 50 users      | 15 minutes | Production readiness |

### Quality Gates

- **Response Time Gates**: 95th percentile under 2 seconds
- **Error Rate Gates**: Under 1% failure rate
- **Custom Error Gates**: Business logic errors under 1%
- **Failure Handling**: Automatic workflow termination on gate failure

## Package Scripts Integration

### New NPM Scripts Added

```json
{
  "test:load:dev": "k6 run --env BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 tests/load/k6/onboarding-wizard.js",
  "test:load:staging": "k6 run --env BASE_URL=https://staging.ccwrapper.dev tests/load/k6/onboarding-wizard.js",
  "test:load:prod": "k6 run --env BASE_URL=https://ccwrapper.dev tests/load/k6/onboarding-wizard.js",
  "test:load:all": "bun run test:load:dev && bun run test:load:staging && sleep 30 && bun run test:load:prod"
}
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Development load testing
bun run test:load:dev

# Staging load testing
bun run test:load:staging

# Production load testing (CAUTION)
bun run test:load:prod

# All environments sequentially
bun run test:load:all
```

- **AI Tools Selection**: 1-3 tools per user, randomized
- **User Types**: solo, team, enterprise (randomized)
- **Workspace Templates**: React, Node.js, Python, Custom (randomized)
- **Think Time**: Realistic delays between actions (1-2 seconds)

### Test Data Generators

- **Random User Generation**: Unique email, username, and preferences
- **AI Tools Combinations**: Realistic tool selection patterns
- **Notification Preferences**: Varied settings for email/in-app notifications

| Complete Onboarding Flow | 5-8 seconds    | End-to-end measurement     |
| Skip Onboarding Flow     | 2-4 seconds    | End-to-end measurement     |
| Profile Access           | 100-300ms      | Database retrieval timing  |
