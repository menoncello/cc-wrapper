## Research Prompt (Ready to Use)

### Research Question

Hybrid TUI implementation strategies for web interfaces that mirror terminal applications

### Research Goal and Context

**Objective:** Technical architecture decision

**Context:**
Act as a full-stack developer and system architect evaluating technical approaches for a multi-instance terminal management platform (CC Wrapper) that requires real-time synchronization between web interface and background CLI processes.

### Scope and Boundaries

**Temporal Scope:** Recent trends (last 2-3 years)

**Geographic Scope:** Global

**Thematic Focus:**
Focus: Real-time synchronization, state management, terminal emulation in web
Exclude: General terminal applications without web components, pure web-based IDEs

### Information Requirements

**Types of Information Needed:**
- Quantitative data and statistics - Performance benchmarks, latency measurements
- Qualitative insights and expert opinions - Implementation experiences, best practices
- Trends and patterns - Emerging approaches in web-terminal integration
- Case studies and examples - Real-world implementations like yours
- Comparative analysis - Different frameworks and approaches
- Technical specifications - WebSocket protocols, terminal emulation libraries
- Industry reports - Developer tool landscape analysis
- News and current events - Recent developments in this space

**Preferred Sources:**
- Technical documentation and implementation guides
- GitHub repositories and code examples
- Developer community discussions (Stack Overflow, Hacker News, dev forums)
- Conference talks and technical presentations
- Open source project documentation
- Performance benchmarking studies

### Output Structure

**Format:** Executive Summary + Detailed Sections

**Required Sections:**
- Current State of Technology - Existing solutions and approaches
- Implementation Patterns - WebSocket, xterm.js, custom terminal emulation
- Performance Considerations - Latency, bandwidth, scalability
- State Management Strategies - Synchronization techniques
- Framework and Library Analysis - xterm.js, TTY.js, WebSocket libraries
- Real-world Examples - Case studies of similar implementations
- Best Practices and Recommendations - Actionable guidance
- Future Outlook - Emerging trends and technologies

**Depth Level:** Standard depth (1-2 pages per section)

### Research Methodology

**Keywords and Technical Terms:**
xterm.js, WebSocket, terminal emulation, state synchronization, Docker, CLI mirroring, real-time communication, web-terminal integration, TUI web interface, terminal multiplexing, background process management

**Special Requirements:**
- Focus on real-world implementation with code examples
- Performance benchmarks where available
- Citation requirements: Include source URLs and links to implementations
- Bias considerations: Consider both commercial and open-source approaches
- Recency requirements: Prioritize sources from 2023-2025
- Technical keywords: xterm.js, WebSocket, terminal emulation, state synchronization, Docker, CLI mirroring
- Avoid: Purely theoretical approaches without implementation examples

**Validation Criteria:**
- Cross-reference multiple sources for key claims
- Identify conflicting viewpoints and resolve them
- Distinguish between facts, expert opinions, and speculation
- Note confidence levels for different findings
- Highlight gaps or areas needing more research

### Follow-up Strategy

If implementation examples are unclear, drill deeper into specific GitHub repositories
If performance data is limited, create separate benchmarking analysis
If multiple frameworks exist, create detailed comparison matrix with pros/cons

- Exclude: General terminal applications without web components, pure web-based IDEs

INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS:
I need:
1. Quantitative data and performance benchmarks (latency measurements, bandwidth requirements)
2. Qualitative insights and expert opinions from implementers
3. Current trends and emerging patterns in web-terminal integration
4. Real-world case studies and examples of similar implementations
5. Comparative analysis of different frameworks and approaches
6. Technical specifications for WebSocket protocols and terminal emulation libraries
7. Industry analysis of the developer tool landscape
8. Recent developments and news in this space

PREFERRED SOURCES:
Focus on technical documentation, GitHub repositories with code examples, developer community discussions (Stack Overflow, Hacker News), conference talks, open source project documentation, and performance benchmarking studies.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
Provide an executive summary followed by detailed sections covering:
1. Current State of Technology - Existing solutions and market landscape
2. Implementation Patterns - WebSocket approaches, xterm.js usage, custom terminal emulation
3. Performance Considerations - Latency, bandwidth usage, scalability factors
4. State Management Strategies - Techniques for synchronizing terminal state

6. Real-world Examples - Detailed case studies of similar implementations
7. Best Practices and Recommendations - Actionable guidance for implementation
8. Future Outlook - Emerging trends and upcoming technologies

DEPTH LEVEL:
Standard depth (1-2 pages per section) with practical examples and implementation guidance.

TECHNICAL KEYWORDS:
xterm.js, WebSocket, terminal emulation, state synchronization, Docker, CLI mirroring, real-time communication, web-terminal integration, TUI web interface, terminal multiplexing, background process management

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus on real-world implementations with actual code examples
- Include performance benchmarks where available
- Provide source URLs and links to all implementations mentioned
- Consider both commercial and open-source approaches
