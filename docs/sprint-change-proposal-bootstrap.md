**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Author:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**User:** Eduardo Menoncello
**Workflow:** Correct Course - Sprint Change Management
**Change Scope:** Minor

---

## Section 1: Issue Summary

**Problem Statement:** CC Wrapper project has comprehensive PRD and detailed epics, but lacks foundational development infrastructure to begin implementation. The project needs a bootstrap epic and story to establish development environment and tooling.

**Context:** During project setup phase, Eduardo identified that while the product requirements and epics are well-defined, there's no clear starting point for actual development work. The project needs technical foundation before beginning Epic 1 implementation.

**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive PRD exists with 24 functional requirements
- Epics 1-2 have detailed story breakdowns (18 stories)
- Epics 3-5 have placeholder structure only
- No development infrastructure or environment setup exists

---

## Section 2: Impact Analysis

### Epic Impact
**Affected Epics:** All epics (0-5)
**Impact Type:** Additive (new epic, no changes to existing)
**Sequencing Impact:** New Epic 0 to be implemented before Epic 1

### Story Impact
**Current Stories:** 18 detailed stories (Epics 1-2)
**Added Stories:** 2 new stories in Epic 0
**Total After Change:** 20 stories with clear implementation starting point

### Artifact Conflicts
**PRD:** ✅ No conflicts - comprehensive and complete
**Architecture:** ✅ No conflicts - documentation exists
**Epics:** ⚠️ Addition of Epic 0 before current Epic 1
**Stories:** ✅ No conflicts - adding foundational stories

### Technical Impact
**Development Timeline:** +1-2 weeks for bootstrap implementation
**Complexity:** Low - standard development environment setup
**Risk:** Low - well-understood requirements and implementation

---

## Section 3: Recommended Approach

**Selected Path:** Direct Adjustment

**Approach Rationale:**
- **Low Risk:** Standard development infrastructure with proven patterns
- **High Value:** Enables immediate start of productive development work
- **Minimal Impact:** No changes to existing epics or requirements
- **Clear sequencing:** Bootstrap before feature implementation

**Effort Estimate:** 1-2 weeks
**Risk Level:** Low
**Timeline Impact:** Minimal (+1-2 weeks)

## Section 4: Detailed Change Proposals

### **Proposal 1: Add Epic 0 - Project Bootstrap & Development Infrastructure**

**Location:** Insert before current Epic 1 in `/docs/epics.md`

**OLD:**
```markdown
## Epic 1: Core Value Delivery & Wait-Time Optimization
[Current Epic 1 content...]
```

**NEW:**
```markdown
## Epic 0: Project Bootstrap & Development Infrastructure

**Expanded Goal:** Establish the foundational development infrastructure, tooling, and project structure necessary to begin CC Wrapper development. This epic ensures the development team has all necessary tools, processes, and infrastructure in place for efficient delivery.

**Value Proposition:** Development team can immediately start productive work with properly configured development environment, CI/CD pipeline, and project infrastructure.

### Story 0.1: Development Environment Setup

**Story 0.1: Configure Development Environment and Tooling**

As a developer,
I want a fully configured development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies,
So that I can immediately start productive development work without setup delays.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Development environment with Node.js, Python, and required runtimes configured
2. Code editor/IDE configuration with extensions and settings
3. Local development database and caching services setup
4. Environment variable management and configuration system
5. Development scripts for common tasks (build, test, lint, deploy)
6. Documentation for development environment setup and troubleshooting

**Prerequisites:** None

### Story 0.2: Initial Project Structure & Build System

**Story 0.2: Establish Project Structure and Build System**

As a developer,
I want a well-organized project structure with automated build and test processes,
So that I can develop efficiently with confidence that code quality is maintained.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Clear project directory structure following best practices
2. Package management configuration (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Build system configuration for production deployments
4. Automated testing framework setup with sample tests
5. Code quality tools (linting, formatting) pre-configured
6. CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated builds and deployments
7. Documentation structure and contribution guidelines

**Prerequisites:** Story 0.1

---

## Epic 1: Core Value Delivery & Wait-Time Optimization
[Current Epic 1 content - unchanged...]
```

**Rationale:** Provides essential foundation for all subsequent development work.

### **Proposal 2: Update Epic Sequencing in PRD**

**Location:** Update epic sequencing section in `/docs/PRD.md`

**OLD:**
```markdown
### **Epic 1: Core Value Delivery & Wait-Time Optimization**
**Goal:** Deliver immediate productivity value through wait-time optimization...
```

**NEW:**
```markdown
### **Epic 0: Project Bootstrap & Development Infrastructure**
**Goal:** Establish foundational development infrastructure and tooling...
**Estimated Story Count:** 2 stories
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

**Key Deliverables:**
- Development environment setup and configuration
- Project structure and build system establishment
- CI/CD pipeline and development tooling
- Documentation and contribution guidelines

---

### **Epic 1: Core Value Delivery & Wait-Time Optimization**
**Goal:** Deliver immediate productivity value through wait-time optimization...
```

**Rationale:** Reflects new epic sequencing without changing core requirements.

## Section 5: Implementation Handoff

### **Change Scope Classification:** Minor

### **Handoff Plan:**

**Route to:** Development team for direct implementation

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Sprint Change Proposal document (this file)
2. ✅ Specific epic and story content for implementation
3. ✅ Updated epic sequencing guidance
4. ✅ Clear implementation prerequisites and dependencies

**Responsibilities:**
- **Development Team:** Implement Epic 0 stories (0.1, 0.2)
- **Product Owner:** Validate epic sequencing and prioritization
- **Scrum Master:** Monitor implementation progress and remove blockers

**Success Criteria:**
- Development environment fully configured and documented
- CI/CD pipeline operational with automated builds
- Team can immediately start Epic 1 implementation
- All development tools and processes established

**Next Steps:**
1. Eduardo approves this Sprint Change Proposal
2. Epic 0 added to project backlog
3. Story 0.1 (Development Environment Setup) prioritized for first sprint
4. Development team begins implementation
5. Progress reviewed in sprint planning and retrospectives
