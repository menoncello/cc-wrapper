## Overview

Epic 0 establishes the foundational development infrastructure and tooling
required to begin CC Wrapper implementation. This epic addresses the critical
gap between comprehensive product requirements (PRD) and technical architecture
(solution-architecture) by creating the development environment, build systems,
and project structure necessary for productive development work.

Based on the sprint change proposal analysis, the project requires bootstrap
infrastructure to enable immediate development productivity. This epic provides
the technical foundation for all subsequent epics, ensuring the development team
has properly configured environments, automated processes, and established
project structure before implementing core features.

The epic directly supports the project's strategic goals of creating an
enterprise-grade AI orchestration platform by establishing development best
practices, quality assurance processes, and deployment pipelines that will scale
with the product's growth from MVP to enterprise SaaS platform.
