## Executive Summary

Through comprehensive architecture elicitation, we identified and addressed
critical vulnerabilities in the CC Wrapper solution architecture. Three advanced
elicitation methods revealed 15+ failure modes and resulted in 25+ specific
architectural improvements across resilience, security, and performance domains.

**Key Impact:** Architecture readiness improved from 95% to 98% with critical
failure prevention strategies implemented.
