## Integration with Development Workflow

### Package Scripts Added

```json
{
  "test:load:dev": "k6 run --env BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 tests/load/k6/onboarding-wizard.js",
  "test:load:staging": "k6 run --env BASE_URL=https://staging.ccwrapper.dev tests/load/k6/onboarding-wizard.js",
  "test:load:prod": "k6 run --env BASE_URL=https://ccwrapper.dev tests/load/k6/onboarding-wizard.js",
  "test:load:all": "bun run test:load:dev && bun run test:load:staging && sleep 30 && bun run test:load:prod",
  "security:audit": "bun audit",
  "security:scan": "bunx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx --config .github/security/.eslintrc.security.js",
  "security:license": "bunx license-checker --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC'"
}
```

### CI/CD Automation

**Triggers:**
- Push to main/develop/story branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Daily scheduled runs for comprehensive scans
- Manual dispatch for on-demand execution

**Execution Strategy:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple security and load tests run concurrently
- **Conditional Logic**: DAST runs only on main branch or schedule
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic environment selection based on branch
- **Gate Enforcement**: Critical issues block pipeline progression

### Quality Gates Status

| Quality Gate | Status | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| TypeScript | ✅ PASS | Zero type errors across all packages |
| ESLint | ✅ PASS | Zero linting errors, security rules active |
| Formatting | ✅ PASS | All code follows Prettier conventions |
| Performance Tests | ✅ PASS | 4/4 tests passing, baseline established |
| Security Scans | ✅ CONFIGURED | Comprehensive pipeline implemented |
| Load Tests | ✅ READY | Scripts created, CI/CD integrated |
