| P3 Test Pass Rate | 0%     | Not yet implemented (acceptable for Epic 0) |

---

### GATE DECISION: ❌ **FAIL**

---

### Rationale

**Why FAIL (not PASS):**

1. **P0 Coverage Below 100%** - Currently at 78% (18/23 criteria). Missing:
   - Physical workspace directories (packages/, services/, apps/) - **CRITICAL
     BLOCKER**
   - Release workflow configuration - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Editor configuration integration testing
   - Quality gate enforcement validation
   - Code quality tool comprehensive validation

2. **P0 Test Pass Rate Below 100%** - Currently at 94.3% (182/193 passing).
   Failures:
   - 11 tests failing including 2 critical E2E tests
   - Missing workspace directories causing test failures
   - Missing CI/CD workflow file

3. **Overall Coverage Below 80%** - Currently at 60% FULL coverage
   - Code coverage at 53.62% (below 80% target)
   - 25/42 acceptance criteria with FULL coverage

**Why FAIL (not CONCERNS):**

- P0 criteria not met - **BLOCKING** issues present
- Critical physical infrastructure missing (workspace directories)
- Test failures in P0 acceptance criteria validation
- Cannot proceed to production deployment with incomplete foundational
  infrastructure

**Critical Blockers:**

1. **Missing Workspace Directories (AC 0.2.1)** - Physical monorepo structure
   incomplete
2. **Missing Release Workflow (AC 0.2.5)** - CI/CD pipeline incomplete
3. **11 Failing Tests** - Cannot release with failing P0 tests

**Recommendation:**

❌ **BLOCK DEPLOYMENT** until critical P0 gaps are resolved:

1. Create missing workspace directories (packages/, services/, apps/)
2. Implement release workflow configuration
3. Fix all failing tests to achieve 100% P0 pass rate
4. Add missing P0 integration tests
5. Re-run traceability workflow after fixes

### Gate Recommendations

#### For FAIL Decision ❌

1. **Block Deployment Immediately**
   - Do NOT deploy to any environment
   - Notify stakeholders of blocking issues
   - Escalate to tech lead and PM

2. **Fix Critical Issues**
   - **Immediate (Today):**
     - Create missing workspace directories (packages/, services/, apps/)
     - Add README.md to each workspace directory
     - Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow
     - Run tests to verify fixes
   - **Short-term (Within 24 hours):**
     - Fix all 11 failing tests
     - Add editor configuration integration tests
     - Add quality gate enforcement E2E tests
   - **Medium-term (Within 48 hours):**
     - Increase code coverage to 80%+
     - Complete remaining P0/P1 test coverage gaps

3. **Re-Run Gate After Fixes**
   - Re-run full test suite after fixes
   - Re-run `bmad tea *trace` workflow
   - Verify decision is PASS or CONCERNS before deploying
   - Target: Achieve 100% P0 coverage and 100% P0 test pass rate

**Deployment BLOCKED until P0 gaps resolved** ❌

---

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions** (next 2-4 hours):

1. Create missing workspace directories (packages/, services/, apps/)
2. Add workspace README.md files with documentation
3. Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow configuration
4. Re-run test suite to verify fixes

**Follow-up Actions** (next 1-2 days):

1. Fix all 11 failing tests to achieve 100% P0 pass rate
2. Add editor configuration integration tests (AC 0.1.4)
3. Add quality gate enforcement E2E tests (AC 0.2.4)
4. Increase code coverage from 53.62% to 80%+
5. Review and enable or remove 62 skipped tests

**Stakeholder Communication**:

- Notify PM: Epic 0 gate decision is FAIL - 3 P0 blockers identified, estimated
  2-4 hours to resolve critical issues
- Notify SM: Epic 0 blocked for deployment until workspace directories created,
  release workflow added, and failing tests fixed
- Notify DEV lead: Immediate action required - create workspace directories and
  release workflow, then re-test
